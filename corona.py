	# COVID-19: The mathematical reason to wash your hands :sweat_drops::clap:
	_Over the past few days, Coronavirus has taken the world by storm. As governments rush to take action to minimize the spread of the diseas, I've built this tool to illustrate why these measures ‚Äì and other measures we can push on an individual basis¬†‚Äì are so important.
	We'll be looking at how staying at home and washing our hands frequently can help us beat the disease ‚Äì using math!_ü§ì 
	## The SIR Method
	By **moving the slider below**, you can play around with the *Contact rate*, ùõΩ of the virus so see how it would affect the evolution of the disease! You'll find the full explanation below the chart.

	### :mag_right: Conclusions
	The parameter ùõΩ represents how often contacts with infected population end in infection. This is the only parameter we ‚Äì as a society ‚Äì can change in this mathematical model. We *need* to push this value lower. Why?
	The chart above gives us some clues!
	* The **lower** this value, the **lower** the **peak number** of infected individuals.
	* The **lower** this value, the **later** the peak of infected individuals. 
	
	In other words, a lower ùõΩ gives us **less total impact** and **more time** to prepare and care for the infected. So, how do we do this?
	* :house_with_garden: We try to stay at home as much as possible. If we all do this, we increase the time between contacts.
	* :sweat_drops::clap: We keep an eye on our hygiene (a.k.a. properly wash our hands). That way if contacts do ocurr, the probability of contagion is as low as possible.

	**Play around with the slider above to lower ùõΩ** and see this concept in action!

	With the [SIR epidemic model] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model_without_vital_dynamics) is governed by 2 parameters: 
	* **The Contact rate, ùõΩ:** This is the **key** parameter in this exercise. It represents the typical time between contacts. It's actually the inverse of that, so a *ùõΩ = 0.5* means 2 days between contacts.
	* **The Recovery rate, $\gamma$: ** This is the inverse of the time an infected individual is contagious. For this exercise, I've used 14 days, which is the recommended quarantine period.

	The SIR model describes the evolution of COVID-19 as a set of ordinary differential equations:
